# Chess Emojis

### Main Purpose

The point of this bot is to analyze your conversations (though as of now, just each individual message) and react with an appropriate chess emoji for each message (brilliant, great, best, excellent, good, book, inaccuracy, mistake, missed win, blunder). To do this, it uses an AI from OpenRouter (specifically openai/gpt-oss-20b).

### Commands

Since this bot sends all of your messages to an AI, and a lot of people probably don't like that, especially without consent or being notified, you can only get reactions if you opt in.

#### /chess-emojis-data-opt-in
This command opts you in to the bot's data collection. This means the bot will read your messages and use them as context of conversation to improve the reactions on other people.
#### /chess-emojis-react-opt-in
This command opts you in to the bot's reactions. This means the bot will read your messages and 
To opt in, run /chess-emojis-opt-in. If you suddenly decide you don't like it anymore, opt out with /chess-emojis-opt-out.
#### um I never finished this
basically look at [the Competitive Chess Emojis repo](https://github.com/lraj23/competitive-chess-emojis)'s readme to understand the commands, except that there is no game in this one, and this bot *ONLY* has opt-in and opt-out commands, no game, leaderboard, or help

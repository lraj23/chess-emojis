# Chess Emojis

### Main Purpose

The point of this bot is to analyze your conversations (though as of now, just each individual message) and react with an appropriate chess emoji for each message (brilliant, great, best, excellent, good, book, inaccuracy, mistake, missed win, blunder). To do this, it uses an AI from OpenRouter (specifically openai/gpt-oss-120b).

### Commands

Since this bot sends all of your messages to an AI, and a lot of people probably don't like that, especially without consent or being notified, you can only get reactions if you opt in. To opt in, run /chess-emojis-opt-in. If you suddenly decide you don't like it anymore, opt out with /chess-emojis-opt-out.
